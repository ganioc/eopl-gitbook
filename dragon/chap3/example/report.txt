Machine Document Processing In this chapter, we see that  comput-
ers have finally come into their own. No more must workers labour
over Gutenberg presses, as they  have  for  generations.   Macros
There  are  many  macro packages available for [4mgroff[24m and freinds.
There are even more available for its predecessor [4mtroff[24m.  The  [4mms[0m
Macro Package The [4mms[24m  macros provide a much needed lift for those
toiling with the basic [4mtroff[24m commands. They (the [4mms[24m  macros)  are
now  used  extensively by writers the world over.  Another day in
the Life of Dean P.  Lately  my life has become more complicated.
Now the boss wants me to remember the names and telephone numbers
of key suppliers, and selected contacts. As if  I  don't  already
have enough to do. Well my memory used to be up to the task , but
in these declining years, if I want to hang on  to  this  job,  I
better work smarter. I think I'll use that new-fangled groff pro-
gram. I hear it's great.
