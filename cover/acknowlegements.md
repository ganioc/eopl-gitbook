Ten years ago, when we were all togheter at Indiana University, we decided to write a book based on the undergraduae programming languages course, C311. We had all taught it and felt that we had a way to unify its representation. Eugene Kohlbecker, we had come to believe in our approach, was also an author. Eugene contributed many hours and hunderds of draft pages at the early stages, and without his taking charge in those early days, we would likely never have gotten started. We owe much to Eugene and use this forum to thank him. About the same time, Will Clinger arrived in Bloomington and he suggested that we change the course from using Lisp to using Scheme. He developed the Scheme 311 compiler, an ancestor of MacScheme, and the course has never been the same. For this and his time as an early author of the book, we thank him.

We very much appreciate having had the opportunity to course-test the book.
