# Foreword

---
This book brings you face-with-face with the most fundamental idea in computer programming:

  The interpreter for a computer language is just another program.


  It sounds obvious, doesn't it? But the implementations are profound. If you are a computational theorist, the interpreter idea recalls Godel's discovery of the limitations of formal logical systems, Turing's concept of universal computer, and von Neumman's basic notion of the stored-program machine. If you're a programmer, mastering the idea of an interpreter is a source of great power. It provokes a real shift in mindset, a basic change in the way you think about programming.
