# Appendix 1

you can dynamically generate/send/execute new source down to the MCU. Only some Forths and luaRTOS 


## A Scheme Interpreter for ARM Microcontrollers
ARMPIT Scheme, interpreter runs on RISC microcontrollers with ARM core.

R5RS version, towards R7RS-small, 

* Designed to support multitasking and multiprocessing
* Armpit Scheme to enrich the spectrum of interpreted languages available for MCU's , Basic, forth, MCU based bytecode interpreters, to compiled languages, eg. C.
* Scheme to the metal, as turning the MCU into a rudimentary scheme machine.
* NanoPC-T3 Plus, communicating via USB, Minicom is used to communicate with the board which reads, evaluates and prints the result of the entered experssions.
* In version 080, base character are from 16-bit unicode set, 
* Cortex-M4F, or above, FPU, an MMU or MPU, SD-card for LSD bootloader,user files are stored on the SD card,
* TM4C1294XL, 120MHz, 256KB RAM
* STM32F429 Discovery, 168MHz, 8MB RAM, 

## LambdaChip,
Lightweight, open source virtual machine, designed to run on embedded systems with limited resources, for instance, an 80 MHz microcontroller with 50KB RAM, programmable with Scheme multi-paradigm programming language. For functional programming research and teaching.

LambdaChip Alonzo, STM32 Cortex-M4 development board with 512KB flash, 128KB RAM, with Bluetooth BLE connectivity,
